🧩 Overview

The Student Grading System is a web-based application that allows teachers and administrators to manage student records, calculate grades, and track academic performance. The system automates manual grading and provides a clean, user-friendly interface for data entry and result visualization.

This project is built with a Node.js backend and a React-based frontend, ensuring a fast, scalable, and responsive experience.

🎯 My Role — Frontend Developer

As the Frontend Developer, I designed and implemented the user interface and client-side logic of the application.
My focus was on:

Developing reusable React components for forms, tables, and dashboards.

Integrating the frontend with Node.js REST APIs.

Handling data visualization and dynamic grade calculation on the UI.

Ensuring responsive and intuitive design using Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap.
